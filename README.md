# RockPaperScissors

My first JavaScript project creating a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors! This game consists of 5 RPS rounds where the user is prompted each round to give their choice of RPS (while the computer has a random choice). After each round, the individual round result is printed on the console (a tie does not give any points to either sides). Finally, after all 5 rounds, the program compares the player score vs computer score to give the final result, including the final game score (e.g. You win! Game score of Player: 3, Computer: 1).
